𝗘𝗨 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗰𝘁: 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘀𝘁?

Are we over-regulating AI in Europe? Could this stifle startups or help create a more ethical and trustworthy AI ecosystem?

Key insights from research (before and after adoption):
A 2022 study (AI Act Impact Survey) of ~100 European startups showed 51% anticipated a slowdown in AI development, with 12% considering relocation or halting AI work; 16% expect a positive impact of the AI Act on their business.

A September 2024 study (Transatlantic Privacy Perceptions (TAPP)) of 66 privacy experts showed that 18% of European experts believe the EU AI Act enables innovation, 30% see it as a barrier, and 36% expect no impact on innovation.

Why might the AI Act hinder innovation? The TAPP experts say:

🟥 High Compliance Costs: Meeting requirements like conformity assessments is expensive.
🟥 Slower AI Development: Resources are diverted to compliance instead of innovation.
🟥 SME Challenges: Small companies face disproportionate burdens, from reporting rules to accessing training data.
🟥 Favoring Big Players: Established companies can better navigate and influence regulations, leaving newcomers at a disadvantage.
🟥 Legal Ambiguity: Vague rules around data use and copyright create risks and deter investment.

Why might the AI Act enable innovation? TAPP experts say:

🟩 Better Governance: Rules can help tackle deep fakes, mass surveillance, and election interference, building public trust in AI safety.
🟩 Stronger Data Practices: Encourages high-quality data governance to meet compliance standards.
🟩 Protection of Rights: Promotes ethical AI by safeguarding individual rights and setting industry standards.
🟩 Legislative Clarity: Provides clear enforcement mechanisms and resists undue influence from large corporations.

In our September 2024 wave of the TAPP survey of privacy experts, we asked: "Do digital privacy laws in your region favor businesses or individual users?" The findings highlight significant regional differences in expert perceptions:

Europe
❗ 🙋 Growing Focus on Individual Rights: 75% of respondents in 2024 believe European laws favor individual users, up from 43% in 2023. This suggests a shift towards stronger privacy protections.

USA
❗ 🏭 Continued Business Favoritism: A strong majority (86% in 2024) perceive U.S. laws as favoring businesses, with no visible change from 2023.

Our September 2024 wave of the TAPP Transatlantic Privacy Survey reveals shifts in how privacy professionals across Europe and the USA view key strategies for digital privacy. In both regions, we asked experts to rank five approaches based on their importance, from 1 (most important) to 5 (least important).

The Five Key Privacy Priorities Surveyed:
1️⃣ Adapting privacy laws to keep up with technological developments
2️⃣ Empowering individuals to control their own data
3️⃣ Enforcing strict rules on data processing, storage, and sharing
4️⃣ Regulating how data is managed and stored
5️⃣ Innovating with privacy-preserving technology

Key insights:
❗ Enforcing Rules is Increasingly Seen as the Top Priority: A higher percentage of privacy experts in both Europe and the USA now believe that “Enforcing rules” should be the most important priority.
❗ In the USA, fewer experts believe “privacy-preserving technology” should be the top priority. Instead, there’s growing support for “Giving individuals control over their data” as the key approach.
❗ Meanwhile, in Europe, there’s a shift away from “Regulating data processing and storage” as the critical measure for privacy protection. This suggests a reevaluation of where regulatory focus is most effective.

Wave 5 of our Transatlantic Privacy Perception (TAPP) Survey reveals how European and USA experts rate major companies on protecting their data in 2024, compared to 2023 and 2022:

Apple: ⬆️ Europe; ⬇️ USA
Meta ⬆️ Europe; ⬇️ USA
Microsoft ⬆️ Europe; ⬇️ USA
Google 🟰 Europe; ⬇️ USA
Visa 🟰 Europe; 🟰 USA
Mastercard ⬆️ Europe; 🟰 USA
Amazon ⬆️ Europe; ⬆️ USA

At TAPP, we’ve been tracking privacy trends since 2022. This year’s results reflect how privacy remains a top concern, especially as companies continue to make headlines for their privacy practices.
For example:
Microsoft recently settled a $20 million case with the FTC over children’s privacy violations.
Amazon has enhanced privacy controls for Alexa and Ring, demonstrating efforts to improve data protection.
Google continues to face privacy challenges, including a settlement to remove personal data.

While we can’t directly link such recent events to the expert ratings, they provide context for how privacy issues keep companies in the spotlight. The focus on privacy is growing, with firms constantly under scrutiny from consumers and regulators alike.

In our recent survey, we delved into the adoption of Responsible AI practices across various fields. Let’s break down some of the findings:

📊 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗲:
• Approximately 59% of respondents either lack guidelines for using AI responsibly or remain uncertain about their existence in the workplace.

• Among the 82 participants:
  • 41% have already implemented clear guidelines for responsible AI.
  • 15% are unsure if such guidelines are in place.
  • 44% reported having no existing framework.

🌟 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:
• It’s encouraging that 41% of respondents already rely on clear guidelines for ensuring responsible AI implementation.
• However, the fact that some individuals are unsure about guidelines in their workplace highlights the need for better communication and awareness regarding AI policies and practices.
• Now, let’s focus on the 36 respondents without existing guidelines: Will they plan to implement a framework or guidelines in the future?

🚀 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱:
• Yes! In the future, the majority intend to implement a framework or guidelines for future AI use in their work or will evaluate to implement one:
  • 44% plan to start using a framework in the future.
  • 33% are still undecided.
  • 22% won’t implement guidelines.

These findings highlight the growing awareness and commitment toward responsible AI practices. Organizations are actively considering frameworks to guide their AI journey responsibly. It is also our aim from the research project team to help educate which frameworks/guidelines are well established, give practical guidance on how to implement them, discuss concerns, and raise awareness of the advantages of adopting Responsible AI frameworks.

Recent data from the Wave 4 Transatlantic Privacy Perceptions (TAPP) survey highlights the significant impact of privacy concerns on the use of AI tools among privacy experts.

Approximately half of the respondents on both sides of the Atlantic indicated that privacy concerns substantially affect their AI usage.

This underscores the urgent need for robust regulation, guidelines, frameworks, and best practices to ensure the safe development, adoption, procurement, and sale of AI technologies. Public and private organizations must be equipped with clear standards to navigate the complex landscape of AI deployment while safeguarding privacy.

Moreover, providers of AI technologies should prioritize transparency about the privacy of the data collected through AI tools. Transparent data practices will build trust and allow users to understand how their data is being used and protected.

In the TAPP Wave 4, we asked privacy experts from Europe and the USA to share which types of AI frameworks their companies and organizations have adopted.

The responses revealed a diverse landscape: 1% of organizations rely on external frameworks 🌐, 29% have developed their own internal frameworks 🏠, and 9% use a combination of both internal standards and external guidelines 🔄.

While neither approach is inherently superior, each presents unique advantages and disadvantages.

🔵 Internal Frameworks, advantages: 
• Customization: Tailored to the specific needs of the organization.
• Collaboration and Industry Knowledge: Internal teams understand the organization’s context, culture, and requirements, enabling effective collaboration with other departments and stakeholders.

🔴 Internal Frameworks, disadvantages:
• Limited Skill Sets: Internal teams may lack specialized expertise in certain areas, such as synthetic data development or bias mitigation.
• Resource Constraints: Developing and maintaining internal guidelines demands significant time, effort, and resources.
• Bias and Blind Spots: Insufficient diversity within internal teams can lead to unintentional biases or blind spots in guidelines.
• Lack of External Perspective: Limited external insights may hinder innovation.
• Scalability Issues: Growing organizations might face challenges scaling these frameworks.

🔵 External Frameworks, advantages 🌐
• Standardization: Promotes industry-wide best practices.
• Updated Guidelines: External frameworks are often maintained by interdisciplinary teams, ensuring they are up-to-date with the latest advancements and regulatory standards.
• Expert Insights and Efficiency: Organizations can save time and resources by leveraging pre-developed guidelines.

🔴 External Frameworks, disadvantages:
• Fit and Nuance: External frameworks may not perfectly align with an organization's specific needs.
• Alignment Challenges: Ensuring alignment between external guidelines and organizational goals can be challenging.
• Dependency on Updates: The timeline of external updates might not always align with internal schedules.

Some Recognized External AI Frameworks 🌟: <br>
• OECD.AI AI Principles <br>
• National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI risk management framework <br>
• ISO <br>
• IEEE <br>
• Google Secure AI Framework <br>
• Microsoft Responsible AI <br>
• AI Governance Trustworthy AI Guidelines <br>
• Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI <br>
• AIGA AI Governance Framework <br>
• IBM AI Governance <br>

✅ A hybrid approach could utilize the advantages of both internal and external AI guidelines and become a good starting point for many organizations.

The decision to adopt internal, external, or hybrid AI frameworks is a strategic one, influenced by an organization’s unique context and goals. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, organizations will need to thoughtfully navigate these choices to utilize the full potential of AI technology.

Earlier, I discussed what control over your own data means for users and companies, why it is important for AI, and how you can have more control over the data you share with AI algorithms. You can find the post here: [https://lnkd.in/deu48y_6](https://lnkd.in/deu48y_6)

Today, let's focus on privacy by design. According to our study, Transatlantic Privacy Perceptions (TAPP), 48% of our experts believe that privacy by design should be one of the guiding principles for developing AI frameworks and guidelines.

🤔 What does privacy by design actually mean? It refers to integrating privacy into the design process from the very beginning, such as setting the highest privacy options as the default.

✍ Why is privacy by design important for AI? We share a lot of information either directly with chatbots or through the data that companies have about our behavior, preferences, purchases, and so on, which is then used to train AI models and develop more advanced chatbots.

☑ For users, privacy by design reduces the mental load when using apps.
☑ Privacy by design significantly reduces the amount of user input data that a company can use for training AI or selling to another company to train their AI.
☑ It potentially reduces data leaks (if nothing is collected in the first place).
☑ While many companies discuss corporate digital responsibility 📣, privacy by design would be an important and impactful practice in this area.

🚀 What does privacy by design look like? For example, if ChatGPT had a "temporary chat" option set as the default and users had to opt in to share their chat history for future training, that would be an example of privacy by design.
